#summary Welcome to OCAML for the iPad

= Introduction =

If you came here because you installed OCAML for the iPad, take a moment to learn
about the benefits of functional programming

This application is pending review at the Apple Store just now. Further review stages may be needed due to the huge flexibility of the language.

This language uses a lot of strange punctuation, although available on the built-in touch pad there may be three or four keypresses per character in some cases. An external wireless or wired keyboard is recommended. The wireless keyboard can be shared with a mac as well.

= Welcome Screen =

The welcome screen it has to be said is a bit plain by iPad standards, fortunately you can change it to whatever you want using the document download/upload feature of iTunes.

Should you wish to show the default screen again after it has cleared, just use

welcome 20;;

where 20 is a number representing the time delay for display
